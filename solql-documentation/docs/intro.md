# Tutorial Intro

Let's have a quick overview of **SolQL**.
In it's current form, the package relies on **Node.js** and [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/) to function.

The aspects of hardhat which SolQL uses will be covered here, but if you wish to learn more about hardhat feel free to look at their documentation [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)
