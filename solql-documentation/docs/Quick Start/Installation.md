For the time being, SolQL is only available as an npm package. 



```bash
npx solql@0.0.12  <TARGET_DIR>
```

Where `TARGET_DIR` is the directory you would like to use solql in.

This command will clone the [solql-workspace](https://github.com/SolQL) repo into your selected directory, and install the dependencies, including hardhat and solql.

After installation, you may enter your projects directory from your terminal by using

```bash
cd <TARGET_DIR>
```
where `TARGET_DIR` is the same directory name you used for installation.
